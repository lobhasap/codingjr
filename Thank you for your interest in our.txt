Thank you for your interest in our internship opening. As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment.

Develop a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that integrates a React-based web chat interface. The chat assistant should support contextual awareness from the current code workspace, allow users to attach files and images via `@filename` mentions, and generate or manipulate code using an AI model.

**Key Features:**

1. **React Web UI Integration**

   * A web-based chat panel rendered using React inside a VS Code WebView.
   * Supports markdown, syntax-highlighted code blocks, and scrolling history.
   * Clean and minimal layout with support for user and AI messages.

3. **File and Image Attachment with `@` Syntax**

   * Typing `@filename` should allow selecting files from the workspace.
   * Attached files (text or image metadata) should be sent as part of the chat input.

4. **AI Code Generation**

   * The assistant should:

     * Generate new code from prompts.
   * Use OpenAI GPT or any suitable language model via API.

**Tech Stack:**

* Language: TypeScript
* Frontend: React (inside VS Code WebView)
* Backend/API: Node.js
* AI Model: OpenAI API (or equivalent)
* Tools: VS Code Extension API, WebView API
